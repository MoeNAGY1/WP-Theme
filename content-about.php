                <p>My full name is Mohamed Nagy, know by Moe. Egyptian by birth and raised in NYC. Graduate of New York City College of Technology with a bachelor in CST, software development track (June 2020).

                    Having learned and put programming to use for over 3 years, I'm now capable of using modern techniques in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to craft memorable online experiences. My practice in web development began before having my degree in software development. My ambition has led me to start iCodetheWeb, where I worked with local businesses and entrepreneurs to help them achieve their online presence. I was fortunate to see my projects receiving positive feedback from my clients. Here I'm today, gaining a reputation, learning more, and becoming better what I like doing most. </p>

                    Using my up to date expertise, I work with passion to create responsive websites, content management systems, or online stores. In addition to creating custom websites, I'm a skilled WordPress developer and experienced with PHP for creating custom WordPress themes. I can work with APIs to bring the desired functionality to your project. You can rely on my abilities to bring your project to where you want it to be.
